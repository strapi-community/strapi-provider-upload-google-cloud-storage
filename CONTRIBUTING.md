## Miscellaneous

### Reporting an issue

Before submitting an issue you need to make sure:

- You are experiencing a concrete technical issue with this plugin.
- You have already searched for related [issues](https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-provider-upload-google-cloud-storage/issues), and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it from your post).
- Your issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.
- You can and do provide steps to reproduce your issue.
- You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right application started.
  - Make sure the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) is respected.
  - Make sure your issue body is readable and [well formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
  - Make sure you've killed the Strapi server with CTRL+C and started it again.
  - Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` directory, meaning:
    - no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run `npm link`)
    - that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` folder
    - that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: 
        - `$ rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
